## ðŸ¦‰ Main information

Multi-page site for Burger House.

Includes the following pages:
- Main page
- Menu page
- News page (with 6 separate pages)
- Career page
- Contact page

In plans, I would like to add functionality to "Add to cart" buttons and connect a payment form in order to directly place an order.

This project was built with Bootstrap5.\
